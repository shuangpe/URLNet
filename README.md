**URLNet**
==========

Introduction
------------

This is an implementation of URLNet - Learning a URL Representation with Deep Learning for Malicious URL Detection
https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03162

URLNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model used to detect
malicious URLs. The model exploits features of URL text string at both character
and word levels.

Resources
---------

URLNet requires Python 2.7 and the following packages:

-   tensorflow 1.4

-   tflearn 0.3

-   numpy 1.14

Sample Commands
---------------

In all datasets for training or testing, each line includes the label and the
URL text string following the template:

`<URL label><tab><URL string>`

**Example:**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+1  http://www.exampledomain.com/urlpath/...

-1  http://www.exampledomain.com/urlpath/...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The URL label is either +1 (Malicious) or -1 (Benign).


The model can be trained by running the following command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
python train.py --FILE_DIR <data_file_directory> --EMB_MODE <embedding_mode> --EMB_DIM <nb_of_embedding_dimensions> --DELIMIT_MODE <url_delimit_mode> --FILTER_SIZES <filter_sizes_separated_by_comma> <convolutional_filter_sizes> --NB_EPOCH <nb_of_training_epochs> --BATCH_SIZE <nb_of_urls_per_batch> --OUTPUT_DIR <model_output_folder_directory>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The training will save all the related word and character dictionaries into an
output folder, and the model checkpoints are saved into `checkpoints/` folder.
By default, maximum 5 checkpoints are stored in the folder.


The model can be tested by running the following command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
python test.py --FILE_DIR <data_file_directory> --WORD_DICT_DIR <word_dictionary_directory> --NGRAM_DICT_DIR <character_in_word_dictionary_directory> --CHAR_DICT_DIR <character_dictionary_directory> --CHECKPOINT_DIR <model_checkpoint_directory> --OUTPUT_DIR <test_result_directory> --EMB_MODE <embedding_mode> --DELIMIT_MODE <url_delimit_mode> --EMB_DIM <nb_of_embedding_dimensions> --BATCH_SIZE <nb_of_urls_per_batch>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test will save the test results for each URL, including 3 columns: `label`
(original label), `predict` (prediction label), and `score` (softmax score). The
orders of test results from top to bottom are the same as their orders in the
test dataset. If the score is more than 0.5, prediction label is +1 (Malicious).
Else, the prediction is -1 (Benign).

**Example:**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
label   predict score

1   1       0.884

-1  -1      0.359
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To obtain test metrics such as True Positive, False Positive, True Negative,
False Negative, and the AUC curves, run the following command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
python auc.py --input_path <test_result_directory> --input_file
<test_result_file>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command will output the test metrics into a file with the same name as the
`input_file` but with an `.auc` extension.

The test parameters such as `EMB_MODE` and `DELIMIT_MODE` have to be consistent
with the trained model to get accurate test results.
